=head1 NAME

Amazon::S3Curl::PurePerl - Pure Perl s3 helper/downloader

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This software is designed to run in low dependency situations. 
You need curl, and you need perl ( If you are on linux, you probably have perl whether you know it or not ).

Maybe you're bootstrapping a system from s3,
or downloading software to a host where you can't/don't want to install anything.
